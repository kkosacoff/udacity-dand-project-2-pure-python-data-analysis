# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree - Project 2 - Pure Python Data Analysis

In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. All of this using pure Python for the data manipulation side. I also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.
